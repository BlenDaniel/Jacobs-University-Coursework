Quiz 5

1.The Lai-Yang algorithm:
A. requires LIFO property since special markers are used to distinguish pre- and post-shot messages
B. inspects received messages and records the local state as it is before receipt of the first preshot message
C. generates feasible snapshots only
D. modifies the messages in transition to determine if they are preshot or postshot

2.A stable property P of configurations occurs:
A. until an execution reaches a configuration in which P holds
B. once an execution reaches a configuration in which P temporary holds
C. when it is not possible for a deadlock to occur in the execution
D. after an execution reaches a configuration in which P will hold

3.A process while performing election is crashing. Which of the following descriptions is correct with respect to a crash-robust election algorithm?
A. The terminal configuration fulfills the consistency requirement for decision
B. Fault-tolerant election algorithms would not be able to detect a fault with this configuration
C. The other processes  can potentially compromise the system
D. It is impossible to conduct election under such circumstances

4.An election algorithm has reached a configuration in which a leader is elected but all other processes are not in state "Lost". Which of the following statements is correct?
A. This displays a configuration where not all processes decided
B. Since this is a trivial configuration, a re-run of the algorithm should be initiated
C. A consensus cannot be reached in this network
D. The configuration satisfies the termination condition
