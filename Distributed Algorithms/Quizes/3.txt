Quiz 3:

1. Upon a successful termination of the traversal algorithm in the initiator, what conclusion can be reached: 
A. an election leader has been discovered,
B. the algorithm has traversed at least half of the network topology,
C. each node has sent at least one message,
D. a minimum of (N, x+1) processes have been visited.

2. The sequential polling algorithm terminates after having exchanged the following:
A. N messages since all nodes receive from the initiator,
B. 2N messages since all nodes receive and send,
C. 2N-1 messages since all leaf nodes receive and send,
D. 4N-1 messages since all leaf nodes are polled twice.

3. The metric to determine the time complexity of a distributed algorithm in an execution can be best described as:
A. the longest message delay within the execution,
B. the number of nodes within an execution,
C. the number of stars in the galaxy because everything is a distributed network,
D. the number of time the weather changes in Bremen within a week.

4. Election Algorithms are intended for the following purpose:
A. to elect a leader to start the initiation of a decentralized algorithm on a network,
B. to elect a leader to start the initiation of a centralized algorithm on a network,
C. to execute multiple algorithms on different parts of the network,
D. to elect multiple processes as leaders which can then initiate a distributed algorithm.


5. The Election Algorithm for Trees has a <wakeup> token. Why?
A. because all edges of the spanning tree need to be included in a free and fair election,
B. the tree algorithm is initiated by all leaf nodes thus all leaf nodes must be initiators,
C. the election algorithm for trees can be applied to any arbitrary topology if <wakeup> is included,
D. the election algorithm is a centralized algorithm and does not require <wakeup> tokens since this only increases message complexity.
