Quiz 2:

1.The theorem Message Bound Refined on Wave Algorithms states that at least |E| messages are exchanged in each computation. Choose the most appropriate from the following statements:
A. the algorithm analyzes the network topology in an arbitrary network because it does not have information on its neighbors
B. the messages exchanged are bounded by N, and not |E|
C. there are channels in the topology that carry no messages at all
D. the connectivity properties state that there always exists a subsection of the topology that is reachable without crossing an arbitrary edge

2. Consider the Ring Algorithm as described on Slide 10, Lecture 11. What do non-initiator processes do if the initiator is generating the token?
A. send their token
B. receive a token
C. wait at receive
D. wait for initiator to decide

3. The Tree Algorithm describes a:
A. centralized wave algorithm for a directed cyclical network
B. decentralized wave algorithms for a Hamiltonian network
C. centralized traversal algorithm for an arbitrary topology
D. decentralized wave algorithm for an undirected, acyclic network

4. Consider the Tree Algorithm as described on Slide 2, Lecture 12. Why are the leaf nodes the initiators of the algorithm?
A. because the algorithm is bottom up
B. because the leaves have only one neighbor
C. because all rec entries for the leaves are true
D. because the algorithm is decentralized

5. Slide 2, Lecture 12 has the pseudocode for the Tree Algorithm. What would be the intended effect of adding in the "for all" statement in line 10 of the code:
A. the algorithm will never terminate
B. the algorithm will lose out on complexity as it now uses twice as many messages
C. in a terminal configuration, all processes will reach a decision
D. when the algorithm terminates, only one process reaches the terminal state
