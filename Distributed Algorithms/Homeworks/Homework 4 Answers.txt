1.1) Leader election:
a) Processes may execute normally as long as a leader remains selected.
b) Concerned with fast and successful termination of election process.
c) Result of leader election must be known to all other processes.
1.2) Mutual exclusion:
a) Process competes until it succeeds.
b) Must ensure that no process is starved.
c) Does not care which process is running in the critical section.

Because <wakeup> messages are forwarded immediately by every process, all processes have started the tree algorithm withing D time units from the start of the whole
algorithm. It remains to show that the time complexity of the tree algorithm, including the flooding of the answer, is D... (there is continuation on this argument, found in the book; it is 3-4 sentences).

Worst way to arrange the ids is in decreasing order (and all processes are initiators): 2nd largest causes n − 1 messages, 3rd largest n − 2 messages etc. => number of messages is then n + (n-1) + ... + 1 + n => O(n^2) -- we need the last n for the leader message.
