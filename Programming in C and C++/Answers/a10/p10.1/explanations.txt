a.

Commenting out "using namespace std" will raise errors in my code and the 
errors are all "identifier ... is undefined". i.e ... is to mean the error 
words. What I understand from this is that "using namespace std" is a way 
to help us use other classes and their methods and functions."using namespace std" 
states that if something in the code is not defined then actually check std as well.

Basically the error says that some of the functions and classes are not defined
and this shows that "using namespace std" was useful in getting the functions from it.
The error might also have been caused by similar functions, classes, variables etc. being available
in different libraries. So "using namespace std" helps to clear out the confusion as to
how from where the functions should be called from.

Possible fix for every function, classes and variables that raises an error is
by added std:: in the begining of the words in use. 
    i.e. std::string var; instead of string var;
This will the the program from where we are getting those specific classes, functions and variables.


b.

I get an error in the body of the function. The errors are similar to that of Commenting out 
"using namespace std". i.e. "identifier .... is undefined". ("..." is to mean the error words.) 
We are having the same issue as before because the compiler does not know from where to get 
the variables to call. This is because we are not specific. The variables that we are calling 
inside the functions need to be defined somewhere. It does not need to be necessary in Critter. 
But if the function is for Critter and it is used to do something with the variables of Critter, 
then we will need to define from where we are getting the variables from.
